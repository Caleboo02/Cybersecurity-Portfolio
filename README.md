# About Me

I am a passionate and dedicated cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong focus on penetration testing and ethical hacking. Currently, I am building hands-on experience by working through practical exercises using industry-standard tools such as Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nmap, and more. My goal is to develop a deep understanding of offensive security techniques and defensive strategies to help organizations protect their digital assets.

I have a solid foundation in networking, operating systems, and security principles, and I continuously seek to expand my knowledge through real-world labs, challenges, and continuous learning. This portfolio showcases my journey, documenting detailed penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, and exploitation techniques in controlled environments.

I am eager to contribute my skills to a professional security team, collaborate on threat detection and mitigation, and grow into a skilled cybersecurity analyst or penetration tester. I am committed to ethical practices and staying updated with the latest security trends and threats.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out for any opportunities or collaboration!
